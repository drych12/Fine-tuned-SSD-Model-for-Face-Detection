# Fine-tuned-SSD-Model-for-Face-Detection
- SUSTech CS324 Deep Learning Final Project<br />
This project focuses on running a deep learning model for face detection on the Jetson Nano development board. Given the limited computational power of the development board, achieving real-time performance requires the use of lightweight models. After evaluation, we selected the SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model for its balance between accuracy and efficiency. The project report describes the modelâ€™s theoretical basis, the datasets used, the training process, and the results of fine-tuning the model for detecting human and cartoon faces.
